    "I use it a lot... Probably more than any other app. But the lack of ability to edit messages is just stupid, the fact that when you are on a three-way call the screen splits such that the video of you is the largest and your friends and family are barely visible (why not a small picture-in-picture of you like other apps?) irritates the hell out of me. But by far the worst problem in recent times is that it does not respond to your phone being in silent mode overnight. Buzzes all damn night.",
    "There's no chance (it's like that in many versions back) that you can edit a video with the result matching what's set in the editor. Everything works fine when you cut off the end of it, but the moment you touch the start marker - don't even hope to see whatever you marked.  I decided to report it straight away after recent update, STILL having this error - version after version - like nobody cares.",
    "I'm so done with this app! Have been using it for years. Yesterday it told me to uninstall and reinstall the app because it wasn't working. When I did so, it said it couldn't detect any previous backed up messages even though my phone backs it up every day. Now I've lost tons of messages, photos and videos. I can't even communicate with WhatsApp because they keep me talking to a robot instead of a real person",
    "Worse with every update and the worst customer support I've ever come across. Very frustrating to use, as updates eliminate normal/common sense features and add useless ones. I am now unable to do the most basic thing one would do in a chat app - check my contacts. First, they eliminated the contacts menu and made you click on \"new chat\" to do this; but now, that's gone too. You have to look for people specifically, using the search function. Just one example among many...",
    "It's my main form of communication. Me and my family used to use the live location feature all the time but since the permission change that won't allow it to access my location all the time even if I have another app open, we have had to use Google maps live location feature instead. Why they had to change it I don't know!!! Please change it back!!!"
